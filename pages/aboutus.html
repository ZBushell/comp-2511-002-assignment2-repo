           <h3>Joshua McWebdesign - Founder</h3>
           <p>
             Joshua, our founder, was born in the early 1800s to a poor family in Oklahoma.
             Armed with nothing but gumption and a dream, he grew B&P Design from a mere shoe-shining stall to the 
             terrifyingly powerful, law-bending multinational conglomerate it is today. 
             Without his consent, we uploaded his consciousness to a computer bank in the basement and 
             trapped him in an infinite Roblox obby to sustain his life countless centuries beyond its natural length.
             To this day, we often seek his business advice when making key decisions.

           <h3>Bob Phigglebottom - Senior Designer</h3>
           <p>
             Bob was born in a barn somewhere in the midwestern United States.
             Although he received no formal education, Bob was trained in HTML, Java and C++ by various talking farm animals. 
             His favorite color is orange. He hates oranges. Bob got his foot stuck in a barrel in 2013, and has yet to free it.
             Apparently Bob once met Jack Black, but we doubt it.

           <h3>Helga Black - Chief Financial Officer</h3>
           <p>
             With multiple degrees in economics, accounting and business, Helga set her
             sights on ruthless, no-holds-barred financial growth. Her first major financial venture, as member of the ethics team
             for Enron, earned her a vast fortune in exchange for infamy. Her second venture, as a hedge fund manager
             tied to the real estate market (up to around 2008), ended with similar results. She now lives in an undisclosed 
             location in the Cayman Islands, and is currently wanted in over 28 countries. 
             This is the only known photo of her.

           <h3>Griffin "Rip" Stabsley - Customer Service</h3>
           <p>
             Not everyone is cut out for customer service. It takes guts. It takes strength. It takes brutality.
             Rip served with distinction in World War II, the Vietnam War and the Gombe Chimpanzee War before joining
             customer service in search of glory. Using his exceptional martial arts skills, Rip is capable of negotiating 
             effectively with just about any client, managing customer expectations and ensuring the needs of B&P design 
             are honored in its daily dealings. Griffin, being the only member of the team able to speak both 
             Chimpanzee and English, serves as a vital lifeline between our executives and Simian Resources department.
